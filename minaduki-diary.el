;;; minaduki-diary.el --- My own way of keeping a diary  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; My alternative to org-roam-dailies, org-journal, or diary.el
;;
;; This was previously part of my .emacs.d. It probably fits here better.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; - M-x `minaduki/visit-entry-date' to visit entries from today.
;; - M-x `minaduki/visit-entry-yesterday' to visit entries from yesterday.
;; - C-u M-x `minaduki/visit-entry-date' to select a day from
;;   the calendar, then visit entries from that day. Days with diary
;;   entries are highlighted in the calendar.
